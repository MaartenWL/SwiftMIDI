// demonstrates how to add packets to a dynamically allocated packetList in swift
// demonstrates iterating over the packets of a const packetList pointed to by UnsafePointer<MIDIPacketList>
// packetList may eventually be 65536 bytes long, when dynamically allocated
// packets may be longer than 256 bytes


// set up a destination for testing
