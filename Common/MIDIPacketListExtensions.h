 @function MIDIPacketGetNextPacket

* @warning When called with the last packet in the list this function will return a dangling pointer!
 
 @param packet A pointer to a const MIDIPacket in a MIDIPacketList.
 
 @result A pointer to the subsequent const MIDIPacket in the MIDIPacketList. Caution! When called with the last packet in the list the result points to arbitrary memory!

 @function  PacketListAdd
 
 @abstract Adds a MIDI event to a MIDIPacketList. The maximum size of a packet list is 65536 bytes. Large sysex messages must be sent in smaller packet lists.
 
 @param packetList The mutable packet list to which the event is to be added.
 @param listSize The size, in bytes, of the packet list.
 @param currentPacket A packet pointer returned by a previous call to PacketListInit or PacketListAdd for this packet list. The pointer is marked as nullable. When imported to swift it will be an optional UnsafeMutablePointer.
 @param timeStamp The new event's time.
 @param dataSize The length of the new event, in bytes.
 @param data The new event. May be a single MIDI event, or a partial sys-ex event.  Running status is not permitted.
 
 @discussion The maximum size of a packet list is 65536 bytes. Large sysex messages must be sent in smaller packet lists.
 
 @result Returns null if there was not room in the packet for the event; otherwise returns a packet pointer which should be passed as currentPacket in a subsequent call to this function.
